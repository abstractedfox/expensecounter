#ExpenseCounter

This is a lightweight app for counting expenses, mostly as an experiment for testing out Django. Right now it doesn't do very much; the database is working and most of the actual useful stuff should be possible closer to the frontend. That part is coming next.

'expensecounter' is the default app, with the actual app being 'ExpenseCounterApp'. Migrations will need to be made to set up the sqlite database.
